AggPasMod
---------
Based on AggPas, which is itself based on the Anti-Grain Geometry, this project offers support for the latest Delphi Versions (XE and above) and contains some helper classes (VCL components and FireMonkey interface).
Initially, I started the port only to see how it compares performance wise. However, it took more than 3 weeks to update the project into the current form. Since I also added several improvments (assembler optimizations,  better code readability, some helper classes), I decided to release my fork of the AggPas port.
The project was hosted on SourceForge and has been moved to GitHub.
